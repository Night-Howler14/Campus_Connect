This is our Course work project where we have to create a software project and were free to choose anything.

Q. Why do we choose this?
- In the current scenario, students do not have a platform where they can:

1. Post their lost complaints. Usually, students email everyone for small things or belongings, which can be separated out.
2. Connect with alumni.
3. Access the module of Seniors of current semesters.
4. Post their belongings so that other students can access them.

We have added a complete SRS document for our project.
